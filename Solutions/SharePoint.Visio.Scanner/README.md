# SharePoint Online Visio Web Access deprecation scanner #

### Summary ###
Visio Online replaces Visio Web Access (also called Visio Services) in SharePoint Online. Visio Online is the new way to view, create and share Visio diagrams in SharePoint Online. As part of the Office Online ecosystem, Visio Online includes a modern UI, introduces performance improvements and has richer capabilities that arenâ€™t available in Visio Web Access (see https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visio/2017/09/25/migrate-from-visio-web-access-to-visio-online) for more details on the actual deprecation. To help you find the relevant files and pages that require remediation work a scanner was developed, which is further explained in this article. If you prefer watching a video then checkout our [PnP Shorts - Visio Web Access deprecation video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/i2fKlUkuuHI).

> Important:
> This deprecation only applies to SharePoint Online, SharePoint on-premises is not impacted.

# What will this tool do for you? #
The main purpose of this tool is to give you a set of reports that you can use to:
- Find all the Visio Web Drawing files (.VDW files) as there need to be saved as VSD or VSDX files to be used in Visio Online
- Find all the pages holding the Visio Web Part: these pages need to be remediated to work with Visio Online

# Quick start guide #
## Download the tool ##
You can download the tool from here:
 - [Visio Web Access scanner for SharePoint Online](https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-Tools/blob/master/Solutions/SharePoint.Visio.Scanner/Releases/SharePoint.Visio.Scanner%20v1.1.zip?raw=true)

Once you've downloaded the tool you have a folder containing the tool **SharePoint.Visio.Scanner.exe**. Start a (PowerShell) command prompt and navigate to that folder so that you can use the tool.

> Note:
> If you want to compile the tool yourself you'll also need to have the SharePoint.Scanning solution available as this tools depends on the SharePoint Scanner framework to compile.

## Using the scanner for SharePoint Online ##
Since this tool needs to be able to scan all site collections it's recommended to use an app-only principal with tenant scoped permissions for the scan. This approach will ensure the tool has access, if you use an account (e.g. your SharePoint tenant admin account) then the tool can only access the sites where this user also has access. You can either use a an Azure AD application or a SharePoint app principal:
 - [Granting access via Azure AD App-Only](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly-azuread)
 - [Granting access via SharePoint App-Only](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly-azureacs)


Once the preparation work is done, let's continue with doing a scan.

### Scanning SharePoint Online environment ###
Below option is the typical usage of the tool for most customers: you specify the mode, your tenant name and the created client id and secret:

```console
SharePoint.Visio.Scanner.exe -t <tenant> -i <clientid> -s <clientsecret>
```

A real life sample:

```console
SharePoint.Visio.Scanner.exe -t contoso -i 7a5c1615-997a-4059-a784-db2245ec7cc1 -s eOb6h+s805O/V3DOpd0dalec33Q6ShrHlSKkSra1FFw=
```

You'll see the following output during the run:

```console

```

After the run you'll find a new sub folder (e.g. 636531090073499869) which contains the following:

Report | Content
---------|----------
**VisioVDWResults.csv** | This report contains an overview of all found Visio Web Drawing files (.vdw files).
**VisioWebPartResults.csv** | Holds a list of pages (wiki page, web part page) that contain one or more instances of the Visio Web Access web part. The Visio Web Access web parts are exported with all properties, for the other web parts on the page only basic information is exported
**Error.csv** | If the scan tool encountered errors then these are logged in this file.
**ScannerSummary.csv** | Logs the number of scanned site collections, webs and list. It will also contain information on scan duration and used scanner version.

### WPData details
For each exported web part the same base JSON structure is used as shown below. Important to note are:
- The "Properties" property holds the web part specific properties in case of a Visio Web Access web part

```JSON
{
	"Type":"<fully qualified web part type>",
	"Id":"6f930c6f-b7d5-44db-b6e7-55d375e4667d",
	"ServerControlId":"6f930c6f-b7d5-44db-b6e7-55d375e4667d",
	"ZoneId":"FullPage",
	"Hidden":false,
	"IsClosed":false,
	"Title":"<web part title>",
	"Order":0,
	"ZoneIndex":0,

# Advanced topics #

## I only want to find the Visio Web Drawing files, can I do that? ##
You might already have an inventory of all the pages holding a Visio Web Access web part from a previous run or from another scanner (e.g. the [modernization scanner](https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-Tools/tree/master/Solutions/SharePoint.Modernization)) and only want to get the Visio Web Drawing files report. This is possible by specifying the -m VdwOnly parameter:

```console
SharePoint.Visio.Scanner.exe -m VdwOnly -t <tenant> -i <clientid> -s <clientsecret>
```

A real life sample:

```console
SharePoint.Visio.Scanner.exe -m VdwOnly -t contoso -i 7a5c1615-997a-4059-a784-db2245ec7cc1 -s eOb6h+s805O/V3DOpd0dalec33Q6ShrHlSKkSra1FFw=
```

## I'm running SharePoint Online dedicated, is this different? ##
In SharePoint Online Dedicated one can have vanity url's like teams.contoso.com which implies that the tool cannot automatically determine the used url's and tenant admin center url. Using below command line switches you can specify the site url's to scan and the tenant admin center url. Note that the urls need to be separated by a comma.

```console
SharePoint.Visio.Scanner -a <tenantadminsite> -r <wildcard urls> -i <clientid> -s <clientsecret>
```

A real life sample:

```console
SharePoint.Visio.Scanner -a https://contoso-admin.contoso.com 
                         -r "https://teams.contoso.com/sites/*,https://portal.contoso.com/*"
                         -i 7a5c1615-997a-4059-a784-db2245ec7cc1 -s eOb6h+s805O/V3DOpd0dalec33Q6ShrHlSKkSra1FFw=

```

## I want to use an Azure AD app to authenticate, how do I that?
This scanner, like all scanners built using the SharePoint Scanner framework, do support Azure AD App-Only:

```console
SharePoint.Visio.Scanner -t <tenant> -i <Azure App ID> -z <Azure AD Domain> 
                         -f "<Path to PFX file holding your certificate" -x <Password for the PFX file>
```

A real life sample:

```console
SharePoint.Visio.Scanner -t contoso -i e4108e9b-9865-44a9-c6e1-9003db04a775 -z contoso.onmicrosoft.com  
                         -f "C:\scanning\AzureADAppOnlyScanning.pfx" -x pwd
```

## I don't want to use app-only, can I use credentials? ##
The best option is to use app-only since that will ensure that the tool can read all site collections but you can also run the tool using credentials.

```console
SharePoint.Visio.Scanner -t <tenant> -u <user> -p <password>
```

A real life sample:

```console
SharePoint.Visio.Scanner -t contoso -c admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com -p mypassword
```
